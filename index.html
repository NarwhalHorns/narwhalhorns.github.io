                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>I am a Computer Science graduate from the University of Sheffield. Currently on the lookout for a graduate role in Software Engineering and Development or anything that will interest me moving forward.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="page">
                <h3>What I like to do?</h3>
                <p>Any other year I would have spent more of my time away from the computer doing other activites, but recent events have made that rare. But I have found things to do in the meantime.</p>
                <ul id="hobbies">
                  <li>
                    <i class="fab fa-2x fa-d-and-d"></i>
                    <div>I have been playing DnD for probably 10 years now and it is still the most interesting and inventive game I've ever seen and has allowed me and my friends to come up with out own immense stories that will stay with me.</div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i class="fas fa-2x fa-book"></i>
                    <div>In the last year I started reading books for something to do indoors for obvious reasons and discovered that I now really enjoy them. Now I enjoy sitting in a comfy armchair in my room with a nice coffee and diving into the pages.</div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i class="fas fa-2x fa-hiking"></i>
                    <div>When given the opportunity I absolutely love hiking and camping. Fresh air and lots of time to force you to do nothing but chat with friends while distracting by the landscape and terrain, perfection. And don't get me started on campfires.</div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i class="fab fa-2x fa-imdb"></i>
                    <div>I LOVE movies and TV. Pretty much anything and everything goes as long as it's entertaining. But nothing really beats Lord of The Rings for movies and I'd say Gravity Falls has the TV crown.</div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i class="fas fa-2x fa-language"></i>
                    <div>I am currently learning Japanese! Their culture and everything else has always interested me since watching Anime and the like. I would like to go out and live their at some point in my life and tour the whole country.</div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i class="fas fa-2x fa-code"></i>
                    <div>Obviously I love to code. Be it programs for school or university or personal projects to count the sources of my thousands of wallpapers, I enjoy it. Something about it just clicks with me and once I get into the flow I can honestly lose hours.</div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i class="fab fa-2x fa-playstation"></i><i class="fab fa-2x fa-steam"></i>
                    <div>Gaming has been a love of mine since I was but a wee boy. Having grown up with the industry I have seen the entire lives of franchises and fallen into their plots and music which have seriously shaped who I am now.</div>
                  </li>                  
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="page">
                <h3>How do I do it?</h3>
                <p>Now for the technical things I can do and perhaps a little about them.</p>
                <ul id="skills">
                  <li>
                    <i class="fab fa-2x fa-html5"></i><i class="fab fa-2x fa-css3-alt"></i><i class="fab fa-2x fa-js"></i>
                    <div>As you may be able to tell from this website, I can use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make websites and web apps. I would also list some back-end frameworks but I have never settled on which ones.</div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i class="fab fa-2x fa-python"></i>
                    <div>Python can be used for a wide variety of things but I have mostly used it as a tool to make little useful things for myself. For example, since I have thousands of wallpapers that cycle on my PC, I lose track of them so I made a little program to count what each one is about and list them in a text file.</div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i class="fab fa-2x fa-java"></i>
                    <div>At first the class system of Java came naturally to me and over the years of learning other languages and practicing them I have come to think it is a little... much. But it works nicely!</div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i class="fab fa-2x fa-github"></i>
                    <div>What else can you use quite as well as GitHub to keep track of all your projects and see practically every other project on the internet that you can then assist with? You tell me.</div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i class="fas fa-coffee"></i>
                    <div>And a lot of coffee</div>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="page">
                <h3>Where can you find me?</h3>
                <p>Unsurprisingly, I spend a lot of time on the web, so I can be found all over. If you wanna see some of my work or get in contact, here are some options.</p>
