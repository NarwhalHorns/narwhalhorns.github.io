    James Mason

    I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Sheffield and looking for a post-graduate position in 2020. I've been using computers since I was able to move a mouse so it has become a skill as well as a long standing hobby. I also play games, watch movies and tv and enjoy hiking and DnD?
